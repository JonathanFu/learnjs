//Exercise 36: Designing and Debugging
/*
Rules For If-Statements
Every if-statement must have an else.
If this else should never be run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies, just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.
Never nest if-statements more than 2 deep and always try to do them 1 deep. This means if you put an if in an if then you should be looking to move that second if into another function.
Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if,elif,else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.
If you follow these simple rules, you will start writing better code than most programmers. Go back to the last exercise and see if I followed all of these rules. If not, fix it.
